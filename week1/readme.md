[Exercise completed]
Exercise 1
    Working with basic data structures:
    The addElement function adds a new element to an array.
    The removeKey function removes a key from an object.
    → Practice manipulating arrays and objects.

Exercise 2
    A simple calculator:
    Performs arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /).
    Has a division by zero check.
    → Practice using switch and conditional logic.

Exercise 3
    Checking access by roles:
    If the role is "admin" → full access.
    If "user" → limited access.
    Otherwise → no access.
    → Practice conditional operators to control access rights.
